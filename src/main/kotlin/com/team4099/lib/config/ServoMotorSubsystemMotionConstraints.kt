/**

 *
 * @param reverseSoftLimit The maximum distance the subsystem can move in the reverse direction. NaN to disable.
 * @param forwardSoftLimit The maximum distance the subsystem can move in the forward direction. NaN to disable.
 * @param cruiseVel The maximum velocity the subsystem will travel at during motion profile based control.
 * @param maxAccel The maximum acceleration of the subsystem during motion profile based control.
 * @param motionProfileCurveStrength The curvature of the generated motion profile. A value of zero disables
